#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  In this module, I learned more about game mechanics and how to make it fun, rewarding, and meaningful for player's enjoyment. When designing game mechanics one of the concepts that stood out to me was to make game mechanics was to allow players to have different ways to engage with the game and encourage creativity to some extent.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I came up with an idea for the final project where the players must go through the life of being a king making choices for their kingdom. It will be played similarly to game of life where at the end the decisions the player make and the amount of money at the end will accumalate together and determine who was the better king. I need to work on some key aspects so it won't be a game of life clone and make it unique.


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Next I need to work on the Design Treatment for my assignment and start getting feedback from others
