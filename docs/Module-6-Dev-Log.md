#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Complete treatment
- [x] Gather peoole for feedback
- [x] Sketch examples for game board


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
    In this module I competed my design treatment for class. I further went into depth of how I want my game to work and was able to come up with some good ideas based off the feeback
  I received from people. Gathering the candidates to provide feedback on my board game idea was relatively easy and I was able to gather half of them through a video call to share simultaneously.
  I created a document explaining my game, mechanics, and an example of my gameboard with additional information.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- In this module I got a better understanding on how the design treatment should look. I looked closely on how the questions for the design treatment should be answered and it made me think on the setting, theme, and story of the board game and not just focusing
- on the mechanics.


#### Free Thinking
-One of the ideas that I came up with based on some feedback given to me is adding an another tile piece on the game board where players are able to challenge each other for their resources. Before I made the challenge feature where the player can challenge others if they land
on a number called a "Lucky number" which is a mechanic in my game. It added another way for players to interact more with each other during gameplay and can encourage an aggressive style of gameplay in order to gain more resources.
#### Next Steps
- Gather materials for physical prototype
- Research material for decision cards
