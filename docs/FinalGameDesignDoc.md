## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics
Player Resources:
- Wealth/Gold = This is will be considered the currency the player will get and will go to the kingdom's treasury and resources. It can be gained through collecting taxes from your subjects, successful management of resources, or collecting war reperations from other players. You can spend this to have the potential to build structures that could increase the amount of taxes you get or landing on crisis tiles.
- Crown points = This will represent the king's influence or dominance. You can potentially gain crown points by landing on a crown tile or regular tile and clicking on a card that offers crown points. Spending this can be done when landing on crisis tiles or challenging other players.
- Wisdom points = This will reflect the king's education. These are gained by landing on  regular tiles and clicking on a card that offers wisdom points. Spending this can be done when landing on crisis tiles or wisdom tiles.

Boardgame tiles:
- Regular Tiles = When landing on this tile, the player will be prompted with two decision cards that are randomized. The cards will offer the player a chance to earn either a 1 crown point or 1 wisdom point. There's a potential to earn both or more than 1 point but at the cost of spending some gold/wealth. These cards will be more uncommon to obtain.
- Crisis Tiles = When landing on this tile, the player will be prompted with a crisis that can make the player either spend a large sum of money, crown points, or wisdom points. There will be extreme cases where you'd have to spend one of the points and along with money.
- Crown Tiles = When landing on this tile, the player will be prompted with card decisions which will offer 1 or more crown points.
- Wisdom Tiles = When landing on this tile, the player will be prompted with card decisions which will offer 1 or more wisdom points. There's a potential to obtain a policy card which can be used to increase the amount of taxes you receive when landing on a tax tile or give a player a lucky number in the number range 1-6. 
- Wealth Tiles = When landing on this tile, the player will be given an obtion to obtain a structure they can build by spening the gold/wealth they have. The structures help increase the amount of taxes you receive when landing on a tax tile.
- Tax Tiles = When landing on this tile or passing, the player will receive a set amount of gold/wealth. May increase after getting a policy card or building a structure.

"Dice roll:
- To move through the different tiles, the player will click a button which will have a number range 1-6. A random number will be selected within that range and that number is the amount of spaces the player can go.

Lucky Number:
- When a player gains a lucky number, other opposing players who roll that number they will need to pay the player who has that number as a lucky number a peace tax. Player's can only have one lucky number at a time. 

Challenging:
- To avoid paying a peace tax the player can spend a crown point. It can only work if player 2(challenger) currently has more crown points than player 1(challenged).
- If the challenge was successful, the player avoids the peace tax for that turn.

Church Loans:
- When a player runs out of gold, they are able to request a loan from the Church/Pope. At the end of the game the amount of loans you've took will subtract from your total score.

### Goals and Challenges
**Goals**
- The main goal for the game is to make it to the end of the board with a legacy that reflects who you are as a ruler. This is measured by the resources of Wealth(Gold), Crown Points(Influence), and Wisdom Points(Knowledge).
- Endure crisis and manage your resources
- Use resources to increase the amount of money you receive.
- Have enough points so it can be collected and added together at the end of the game to determine the winner.

**Challenges**
- Crisis tiles will deplete your resources(Wealth, Crown, or Wisdom points).
- Prioritizing which resources is needed on your journey through the game board.
- Randomized decision cards makes it difficult to plan ahead
- Lucky Number mechanic forces players to either pay money to opponents or spend their Crown Points to challenge them.
- Must decide when to contest a peace tax versus saving your Crown Points for other challenges.

### Progression
- As you move forward in the game you are competing with the other players to have the most resources in order to win.

### Game Rules
- Rules are relatively simple. Each player gets to roll in order from whoever is player 1 to player 4.
- Each tile type triggers a unique event when landed on and prompts decision cards with two choices affecting player resources
- Resource types include Gold, Crown, Wisdom, and Wealth (cards). Choices may grant or cost these.
- If a player lacks resources for a card option, they may accept a 600 gold loan from the Church, with a –600 point penalty per loan applied at the end.
- Players cannot take another turn after reaching the end.
- Players with a wealth card can only equip one at a time since they provide more passive income via tax bonuses.
- The game ends when all players reach the last tile on the board. Scores are calculated from all resources, with bonus points from titles like “Wise Ruler” or “Cunning Monarch” awarded to category leaders. Ties for a category result in no title.
- Player with the highest total score wins.

## Inspiration

### Sources
- Game of Life
- CIV 6
- Mount and Blade Bannerlord
- Yes your grace

### Why It Matters
The game blends inspirations from CIV 6, Game of Life, Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, and Yes, Your Grace to create a strategic yet accessible kingdom building experience. From CIV 6, it inherits resource management and decision making with long-term consequences. Game of Life inspired the tile-based progression and life path choices. Mount & Blade: Bannerlord influences the medieval theme and the idea of personal growth through titles and reputation. Finally, Yes, Your Grace shapes the moral weight of decisions like taking church loans and the narrative of ruling a kingdom under pressure.

---

## Player Experience Goals
- The game is suppose to cause a mix of curiosity and tension. PLayers feel curious when drawing cards, unsure of what reward or penalty it gives them. Tension rises when deciding between risky opportunities and safe plays especially when reasources are low and rival players are close to winning.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
PC

### Tools
- Uses Unity
- Uses C# scripting
- AI used to help analyze any errors that appeared during development

---

## Art and Sound Direction

### Visual Style
- The visual style is a blend of medieval inspired aesthetics with clean, colorful UI elements. Each tile type is visually distinct to convey purpose at a glance, while the interface uses sharp and readable fonts.

### Sound Design
- There's no sound design within the game.

---

## Monetization Strategy
- The game would be a free game or a one-time purchase of $1.

---

## Treatment Details

### Gameplay Example
**Starting the Game**
- The player selects the number of players (2–4) from the initial UI. Each player is assigned a unique color, a Player Token appears on the start tile, and their individual resource panels activate.

**Rolling the Dice**
- On their turn, Player 1 presses the spacebar to roll the dice. The game animates a die roll and shows a result from 1 to 6, then the Player Token moves that number of tiles across the board.

**Decision Points & Forks**
- If the player reaches a fork in the road, a Decision Panel appears offering a "Left" or "Right" choice. Based on the choice, the player continues their movement path.

**Landing on a Tile**
- Once movement ends, the tile type determines what happens:

- Crisis Tile: Draws a Crisis card (e.g., “Plague outbreak”) with two choices—both may cost or reward resources.

- Wealth Tile: Offers a Wealth Card purchase, granting long-term tax bonuses if accepted.

- Tax Tile: Awards gold (plus any wealth card bonuses).

- Other Tiles: Trigger wisdom, crown, or regular cards with meaningful decisions.

**Making a Card Decision**
- The player reads the card's choices and picks one. If they lack the resources to choose, a panel offers a church loan (+600 gold, -600 score penalty). Choices impact gold, wisdom, or crown resources, and may shape endgame scoring.

**Turn Ends**
- Once the card decision is made, the next player's turn begins.

**Reaching the End Tile**
- When a player reaches the Finish tile, they can no longer take turns. Once all players finish, the game tallies resources, applies bonuses/penalties, and displays the EndGameStats panel with titles ("Wise Ruler") and a final winner.

---

### Challenges and Considerations

#### Potential Risks
**Balancing Card Effects**
- Some cards may offer choices that are either too punishing or overly rewarding, which can create unbalanced progression or runaway leads.

**Church Loan System**
- While it's a useful fallback, players might exploit it if the penalty isn't harsh enough or avoid it entirely if the penalty is too steep.

**Difficulty Curve**
- The randomness of dice rolls combined with tile distribution may create inconsistent pacing and some players may hit Crisis tiles too often, while others coast without challenge.

#### Feasibility
