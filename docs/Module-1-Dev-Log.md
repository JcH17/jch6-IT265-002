- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  I was having issues setting up my Github pages. When I went to create it in the github webpage, it attempted to build but failed. I attempted to restart the process again but then the progress got stuck in queuing stage.

  After contacting professor Toegel about my issue, he was able to walk me through it. All I needed to do was create the docs folder manually on the github webpage and the github pages was able to build correctly.
