#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Play or review some games I've played to complete HW assignment
- [x] Complete Discussion on bad game mechanics


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I pretty much installed and replayed some games that I can write about for my homework except Call of Duty MW2(2022) which was one of the games I wrote about, because I dislike it and I didn't really need a reminder of what they did wrong. I put down some notes of whatever came to my mind while playing through the games again on what were some mechanics that were annoying or a inconvience to me as a player.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  In this module I was able to get a good understanding on how look and feel drive game design. Immersion in a game is dependent on ambience, storytelling, and interface. There was also a discussion of how color helps enhance immersion and gameplay experience such as interactive elements and creating a mood within a game.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  N/A

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Begin some brainstorming and have a good idea of what can I game I'd like to create for the semester
