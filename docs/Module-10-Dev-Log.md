#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Import Basic Assets:
  -Placeholder tokens (for player pieces)
  -Basic tiles (colored squares)

- [x] Design the board layout (grid-based, linear path, or circular depending on your vision).
      Create Tile GameObjects for:
          Regular Tiles
          Crown Tiles
          Wisdom Tiles
          Wealth Tiles
          Crisis Tiles
          Tax Tiles

- [x]Create tile script for Tile gameobjects


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
    I worked on my placeholder player pieces and tiles for my boardgame and made them into prefabs that I will use. I then set up the gameboard and placed the tiles in the placements I wanted.
  I added scripts for my player piece regarding playerManager = Handling number of players & PlayerMovement = handling movement of the player. Both scripts haven't been worked on fully. I created a Tile script
  to handle the different tile types on the board game(e.g crisis tile, wealth tile, regular tile, etc.) and added the scripts onto the tile prefabs and selected the correlated tile type.
