#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Start treatment for game
- [x] Sketch rough ideas of the game board


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  In this module I started working on the treatment document for my game. My game idea is still the same, that the player will play the role of a king and progress through their life as a king and make decisions for their kingdom.
  The game format will be played similarly to Game of Life but there's still some changes that may need to be done to the idea so that it's not an exact clone. I also sketch a rough idea of how I want the game board to be and how different paths will give players options to choose based on the path they've chosen.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  During this module, I learned more on planning and managing a game which helped give me a start on planning for my game.
-  Some key insights were to conceptualize the core themes of the game, outline goals and key mechanics, research mechanics of other games to better refine yours, test the game mechanic, and playtest to gather more feedback in order to refine.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I thought of adding an element from the Civilizations game franchise on how the game is won(e.g Culutural win, Religious Win, Science, or Dominance)
-  Let's say the player chooses a religious path of a king, if they accumulate a set amount of religious points they can win or generate a high score which will help them at the end of the game when everyone's score is tallied up.
#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Research more on what more game mechanics I can have in my game.
-  Look at other board games for inspiration and then finish the treatment document.
-  Present game idea to others for feedback
